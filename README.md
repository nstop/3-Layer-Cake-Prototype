DESCRIPTION

3-Layer-Cake Prototype is a framework for creating multi-layered, annotated, web-based protoypes using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  It uses JavaScript to switch between various versions -- full design, "sketchy" wireframes, annotated design -- of each page in a prototype.  As annotations are dynamically-applied using CSS3 content generation, a modern web browser with robust CSS3 support (examples as of this writing: the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari) is required for full functionality.

This is a ZIP file containing all of the files used in the "3-Layer-Cake Prototype" as demonstrated in the presentation "Web-Native UX Design: Prototyping with HTML, CSS and jQuery" (http://www.slideshare.net/nstop/webnative-ux-design-prototyping-with-html-css-and-jquery).
